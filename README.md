## HandsOn

### HandsOn1 - Binary Tree
Given a Rust's implementation of a Binary Tree, implement methods to solve the following exercises:

1. **Check if the tree is a Binary Search Tree:**
Write a method to check if the binary tree is a Binary Search Tree. Recall that a Binary Search Tree is a binary tree where, for every node n in the tree, the maximum key in its left subtree is less than n’s key, and the minimum key in its right subtree is greater than n’s key.
2. **Find the Maximum Path Sum:**
The task consists in finding the maximum sum of a simple path connecting two leaves in a given tree. The method should only return the sum of the found path.
